# Freddoflation 🍫📈

Freddoflation tracks the rise in the price of a Freddo over time — a light-hearted look at inflation through one of the UK’s most important economic indicators.

What started as a joke has somehow become a genuinely depressing data set.

## About

Freddoflation visualises how the price of a single Cadbury Freddo has increased over the years, based on widely reported prices and public nostalgia.

The project is intentionally simple, fast and accessible — inspired by small, fun data projects like fastfoodindex.
